-An operating system is software that manages 
computer hardware and acts as an intermediary between the programs and the hardware.

-Kernel is the core part of the operating 
system that is always running that manages computer hardware and the computer can't run without it.

-An interrupt is a mechanism that allows the 
CPU to work in parallel with devices by sending 
it a signal when something important happens. 
The CPU can then pause what it’s doing and handle the event.

- An interrupt is a signal sent to the CPU that tells it to 
pause what it’s doing and handle something important right now.


-When someone presses the "A" key on the keyboard:

1. The **keyboard controller** detects the key press.
2. The controller stores the value of the keystroke in its **buffer**.
3. The controller sends an **interrupt signal** to the CPU.
4. The CPU temporarily **pauses its current task** and calls the **interrupt handler**.
5. The **interrupt handler** invokes the **keyboard driver**.
6. The driver reads the keystroke from the controller's buffer.
7. Finally, the driver sends the keystroke information to the **operating system** for use by programs.
